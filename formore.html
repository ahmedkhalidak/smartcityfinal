        <h3>1. Make It Easy to Get Around Without a Car</h3>
        <img alt="City bike lanes" class="center50" src="images/1.jpg"><br />
        <p class="types">Automobiles account for <a style="color: #4379a8;" class="underline" href="https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/smog-soot-and-local-air-pollution" target="_blank" >75% of CO pollution in the U.S.</a> Cities striving for sustainability can create paths, bike bridges and sidewalks, and encourage citizens to walk, ride, or commute via metro trains or buses. These are some of the critical components of sustainable urban development because of their many benefits:</p>
        
        <ul style="color: #026047;" class="meow">
          <li>Decreased congestion&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Reduction of harmful emissions</li>
          <li>Enhanced air quality</li>
          <li>Improved health and wellness</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="types">In Copenhagen, bicycles outnumber cars by over 5:1, and nearly half the population commutes by bike. City management has achieved this bike culture by building cycle superhighways with ample amenities along the way, including traffic lights, air pumps, and safer intersections.</p><br />
        &nbsp;
        <h3>2. Add EV Charging Stations&nbsp;</h3>
        <img alt="Electric vehicle charging stations" class="center50" src="images/2.jpg" /><br />
        <p class="types">Whereas conventional fuel-driven vehicles generate an average of 4.6 metric tons per year, hybrids can cut that in half, and electric vehicles produce zero. Cities aiming for carbon neutrality must include EV charging stations in their sustainable city planning.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp</p>;<br />
        <p class="types">Urban areas can incentivize the construction of these stations, and planners can team up with developers to map out appropriate locations for charging stations. Key benefits include:</p>
        <ul style="color: #026047;" class="meow">
          <li>Lower transportation costs</li>
          <li>Reduced strain on traffic management infrastructure</li>
          <li>Massive reduction of carbon emissions</li>
          <li>Cleaner air</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="types">San Francisco, the fourth most populous city of California, has mandated that garages and parking lots install EV charging stations for over 10% of their spaces. The city aims to achieve 100% emission-free ground transportation within 20 years</p>.<br />
        &nbsp;</p>
        <h3>3. Provide Access to Public Resources and Green Spaces&nbsp;</h3>
        <img alt="City green space" class="center50" src="images/3.jpg" /><br />
        <p class="types">Access to nature and walking/biking paths are key elements of a sustainable city. Resources like parks, nature preserves and recreational areas get people out of cars. And studies have shown that <a class="underline" style="color: #4379a8;" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145305/green-space-is-good-for-mental-health" target="_blank" >green spaces help improve mental health</a>.<br />
        &nbsp</p class="types"><br />
        <p class="types">Infrastructure designs and urban landscaping can go a long way toward enhancing public resources and making cities more vibrant. Some of the benefits of this feature include:</p>
        <ul style="color: #026047;" class="meow">
          <li>More livable urban centers</li>
          <li>Improved urban mobility</li>
          <li>Support for a diverse ecosystem, including birds, bees and butterflies</li>
          <li>Mental health for residents</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="types">New York is one of the most advanced cities for sustainability. The Big Apple is implementing multiple <a class="underline" style="color: #4379a8" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/index.page" target="_blank" >sustainability programs</a>, from a Carbon Challenge which aims for 50% emissions reduction by 2025 to a Zero Waste project, city bike rentals and urban parks built on landfill sites.<br />
        &nbsp;</p>
        <h3>4. Improve Water Conservation and Waste Management</h3>
        
        <img alt="Water management system" class="leftimg" src="images/4.jpg"><h5 class="klam">Cities can improve water conservation and waste management through sustainable urban planning  With water shortages increasing across,technology to <a class="underline" style="color: #4379a8;" href="https://www.digi.com/customer-stories/brown-and-caldwell-uses-digi-to-help-monitor-water" target="_blank" > monitor water systems</a> and provide leak detection is key, along with incentives for citizens and businesses to save water.
     Likewise, waste disposal processes can shift toward a <a class="underline" style="color:  #4379a8;" href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/concept" target="_blank"  >circular economy model</a>, and sustainable city waste management. Programs to minimize waste by recycling, composting, and repurposing materials are some proven ways cities can be more sustainable with waste management.</h5><br/>
        &nbsp;</h5><br/><br>
        <img alt="City recycling system" class="rightimg" src="images/00.jpg" /><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h5 class="heyy">The benefits are many:</h5>
        <ul style="color: #026047;" class="meow">
          <li>Fewer water shortages</li>
          <li>Enhanced availability of water for recreational purposes</li>
          <li>Reduced waste, and the energy used to manage it</li>
          <li>Less environmental pollution</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="types">For example, Dubai is an entirely self-sustainable city via renewable energy. The city is powered by clean energy produced by recycling water and waste, has 60% green space irrigated with gray wastewater, and has banned single-use plastic bags.<br />
        &nbsp;</p>
        <h3>5. Support Urban Farming&nbsp;</h3>
        <img alt="Urban farming" class="center50" src="images/5.jpg" /><br />
        <p class="types">Food is second to energy as the most in-demand city resource. Urban farming enhances food production, reduces food insecurity and mitigates the environmental effects of food transportation. And growing food locally reduces the distance from farm to consumer. Urban farming practices include vertical gardens, rooftop farming, community gardens, and encouraging schools and restaurants to grow food.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;</p><br />
        <p style="width: 700px; font-size: 20px; padding-left: 30px;">There are several great benefits:</p>
        <ul style="color: #026047;" class="meow">
          <li>Meeting the growing demand for local food</li>
          <li>Boosting the local economy</li>
          <li>Transforming under-utilized spaces into vibrant and edible landscapes</li>
          <li>Reducing the environmental impact of agriculture supply chain</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="types">Several cities have taken leadership roles in developing urban farming programs, according to <a class="underline" style="color: #4379a8;" href="https://www.agritecture.com/blog/2021/2/23/top-10-cities-for-urban-ag" target="_blank" >Agritecture</a>. For example, Victoria B.C. has a program to distribute seedlings to communities. Atlanta, Georgia has a program to educate school children in urban farming. And New York City now has over 550 community gardens.<br />
        &nbsp;</p>
        <h3>6. Implement Green Architecture</h3>
        <img style="padding-bottom: 50px;" alt="Green building technology" class="centerlast" src="images/99.jpg" /><br />
        <p class="types"> When we talk about sustainable development and cities, green architecture is a key component. Green architects are discovering innovative ways to reduce resource use and lower greenhouse gas emissions &mdash; from using natural building materials and solar panels, to improving ventilation and insulation, planting more shade trees and installing <a class="underline" style="color: #4379a8;" href="https://www.digi.com/customer-stories/infinitum-delivers-reduced-footprint-motor" target="_blank" >smart HVAC systems</a>.&nbsp;Green buildings can meet certain requirements to get LEED-certified, which is increasingly desirable for tenants.<br />
